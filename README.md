-Update
Sample code was added to the repository. this is code was used for an information system that solves problems with regards to stock tacking, customer database, inventory, discounts, and a database for employees.
This was accessible via the use of a GUI.

The problem solving approach we used was:
- Determine what the requirements of the information system set out by the customer 
- Design the system logically making use of diagrams 
- Create the database component of the System
- Create the UI along with the back end code for the system
- Test the system to find any errors, bugs and problems.
- Implement the system.
